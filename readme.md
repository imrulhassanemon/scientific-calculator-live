## ðŸ§® Calculator Project Description:
I developed a functional calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of my campus assignment. The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and also supports advanced mathematical functions such as logarithm (log), natural log (ln), trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), and constants like Ï€ (pi) and e (Euler's number).

### The project demonstrates my understanding of:

User inputs are processed and dynamically evaluated using JavaScript's eval() method with safe parsing and replacements for math functions. I used regular expressions to correctly convert functions like log(x) to JavaScript's Math.log10(x) for accurate computation.


 - DOM manipulation
 - String handling
 - Basic use of eval() with input sanitization
 - Tailwind CSS and Vanila CSS
